# Core Economic Roles and Agent Modeling in EconGym

EconGym provides a unified framework to simulate heterogeneous economic roles as agents in a Markov game. This document introduces the **core economic roles** and details the **agent modeling setup** (observations, actions, and rewards) for each role.

## Core Economic Roles

Each role type captures distinct modeling features and aligns with specific scenarios, enabling flexible composition of diverse simulations.

| **Roles**       | **Role Type**         | **Description** | **Typical Scenarios** |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Individual**   | Ramsey model          | Ramsey agents are infinitely-lived households facing idiosyncratic income shocks and incomplete markets. | Wealth distribution, long-term dynamics |
|                  | OLG model             | OLG agents are age-specific and capture lifecycle dynamics between working-age (Young) and retired (Old) individuals. | Retirement policy, demographic shifts |
| **Government**   | Fiscal Authority      | Fiscal Authority sets tax policy and spending, shaping production, consumption, and redistribution. | Fiscal policy, redistribution |
|                  | Central Bank          | Central Bank adjusts nominal interest rates and reserve requirements, transmitting monetary policy to households and firms. | Monetary policy, inflation control |
|                  | Pension Authority     | Pension Authority manages intergenerational transfers by setting retirement age, contribution rates, and pension payouts. | Aging society, pension system reform |
| **Bank**         | Non-Profit Platforms  | Non-Profit Platforms apply a uniform interest rate to deposits and loans, eliminating arbitrage and profit motives. | Simplified setting |
|                  | Commercial Bank       | Commercial Banks strategically set deposit and lending rates to maximize profits, subject to central bank constraints. | Policy impact on financial markets |
| **Firm**         | Perfect Competition   | Perfectly Competitive Firms are price takers with no strategic behavior, ideal for baseline analyses. | Equilibrium analysis |
|                  | Monopoly              | Monopoly Firms set prices and wages to maximize profits under aggregate demand constraints. | Market power, regulation |
|                  | Oligopoly             | Oligopoly Firms engage in strategic competition, anticipating household responses and rival actions. | Cournot, collusion, AI pricing |
|                  | Monopolistic Competition | Monopolistic Competitors offer differentiated products with CES demand and endogenous entry, supporting studies of consumer preference and market variety. | Branding, pricing strategy |

## Agent Modeling

Building on the economic roles, EconGym models each heterogeneous role as a distinct agent in a **Markov game**.  

- Each agent has a **role-specific observation space**, **action space**, and **reward function**.  
- Given its private observation, each agent selects actions and receives rewards.  
- Environment transitions are defined by economic mechanisms (see Appendix C in the paper).  

This setup allows heterogeneous agents to interact in diverse scenarios.

The following table summarizes the observation $o_t$, action $a_t$, and reward $r_t$ for each agent type. Notation and economic meaning are annotated for clarity.

## Agent Algorithms

| **Agent Algorithm**             | **Description**                                              | **Example Use Case**                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | Learns through trial-and-error to optimize long-term cumulative rewards. Well-suited for solving dynamic decision-making problems. | Dynamic environments requiring optimal decision-making.      |
| **Large Language Model (LLM)**  | Generates decisions based on internal knowledge and language understanding. Exhibits human-like behavior patterns. | Simulating realistic decision-making with human-like behavior, or targeting unstructured text data. |
| **Behavior Cloning (BC)**       | Imitates real-world behavior by training on empirical data. Enables realistic micro-level behavior. | Individual households following BC policies from the [2022 Survey of Consumer Finances data](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm). |
| **Economic Method**             | Uses classical rule-based policies from economics literature (e.g., Taylor rule, Saez Tax). Provides direct comparisons between economic theory and AI-based methods. | Central banks (Taylor rule) or fiscal agents (Saez Tax).     |
| **Rule-based Method**           | Encodes domain knowledge or user-defined heuristics (e.g., IMF’s fiscal adjustment rule). Provides interpretable, human-crafted policies. | E.g., “save more when young for retirement”.                 |
| **Real-Data**                   | Replays actual policy trajectories based on historical data (e.g., U.S. federal tax rates). Enables benchmarking against real-world policy outcomes. | U.S. federal tax rates, retirement age schedules.            |

Each algorithm has its own strengths. EconGym supports benchmarking them under the same economic role, or combining different algorithms across roles in a shared scenario. In the following experiments, we showcase how these algorithms generate diverse policy outcomes across tasks.
