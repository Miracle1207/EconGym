# Q4: How does product diversity affect welfare?

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Concerns over Product Variety in Monopolistic Competition Markets

* In monopolistic competition, firms offer differentiated products to niche segments, expanding consumer choice but potentially causing redundant resource allocation and declining scale efficiencies. Theoretically, **excessive product variety can undermine aggregate welfare, making the trade-off between “freedom of choice” and “efficiency optimality” a critical research question.**
* New Keynesian and New Trade theories suggest that **moderate variety boosts consumer surplus and market dynamism**. However, if firms over-segment products, duplicate production capacity, or shift focus from innovation to marketing, social resources may be used inefficiently. Hence, we need to quantify the net welfare effect of product variety across economic environments.

### 1.3 Research Questions

Using an economic-simulation platform, this study examines the mechanisms by which changes in product variety affect social welfare, focusing on:

* Whether RL-driven firms naturally evolve toward “excessive variety.”
* How pursuit of variety impacts resource-allocation efficiency at different levels of market concentration.

### 1.4 Research Significance

* **Microfoundation for Competition Policy and Product Regulation:** Quantify the marginal welfare effects of variety to inform “anti-over-differentiation” regulatory frameworks.
* **Enhancing Realism in Market Simulations:** Incorporate AI agents into firm behavior models to explore how product-strategy evolution balances personalization with profit maximization.
* **Highlighting the Tension Between Choice and Efficiency:** Shed light on achieving a dynamic balance between individualized consumption and system-wide efficiency.

## **2. Selected Economic Roles**

As an example, we selected the following roles from the social role classification of the economic simulation platform. These roles align with the core understanding of the issue and are convenient to implement from an experimental perspective:

| Social Role            | Selected Type                            | Role Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual             | Ramsey Model                             | Rationally choose preferred goods, reflecting the marginal utility of variety and price sensitivity.                                      |
| Government             | Fiscal Authority                     | Oversee market competition and product‐classification policies, assessing when policy intervention is needed to limit excessive variety. |
| Firm                 | Monopolistic Competition Market          | Firms employ product‐differentiation strategies to compete for market share, serving as the direct source of changes in variety.         |
| Bank  | No-Arbitrage Platform | Provide capital support and feedback on long‐term investment efficiency and macroeconomic return paths.                                  |

### Individual → Ramsey Model

* Households maximize utility when choosing products, showing sensitivity to prices, variety, and brand preferences; they are the core agents for measuring welfare changes.

### Government → Fiscal Authority

* As the regulatory authority, the government may set standards or implement incentives/restrictions on firms’ diversification behaviors; its policy‐response mechanisms should be incorporated into the model.

### Firm → Monopolistic Competition Market

* Firms hold pricing power and engage in non‐price competition through differentiation strategies, forming the key structural foundation of the simulation.

### Bank → No-Arbitrage Platform

* Provide business loans and household‐savings platforms, reflecting the efficiency of resource allocation over long‐run paths and aiding analysis of macro‐efficiency changes.

## **3. Selected Agent Algorithms**

*(This section provides a recommended agent configuration. Users are encouraged to adjust agent types based on the specific needs of their experiments.)*

| Social Role            | AI Agent Type          | Role Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Individual             | Behavior Cloning Agent | Reproduce consumers’ reactions to prices and product variety based on real preference data.                                             |
| Government             | Rule-Based Agent       | Monitor product-differentiation trends under fixed policy rules, identifying intervention thresholds and boundaries.                     |
| Firm                 | RL Agent               | Firms dynamically adjust product strategies via reinforcement learning to optimize profits and market share.                             |
| Bank | Rule-Based Agent       | Reflect resource-allocation efficiency in the financial system and simulate how interest-rate changes affect firms’ expansion capacity. |

### Individual → BC Agent

* A Behavior Cloning Agent trained on historical consumption data simulates consumer choice preferences, capturing real‐world reactions to brand, category, and other variety factors, thereby enhancing the fidelity of consumer behavior in the simulation.

### Government → Rule-Based Agent

* The government applies fixed policy rules based on market structure and welfare indicators (e.g., “issue antitrust guidance when market concentration exceeds a threshold”), creating a controlled environment for policy experiments.

### Firm → RL Agent

* Firms use reinforcement learning to discover profit‐maximizing strategies—such as whether to expand product lines, set price levels, or enter/exit markets—thus modeling the endogenous evolution of the variety–efficiency trade‐off.

### Bank → Rule-Based Agent

* Interest‐rate and lending policies automatically adjust according to economic variables (e.g., market returns, asset distributions), ensuring stable foundational operations of the financial market.
